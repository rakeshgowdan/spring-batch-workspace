Spring Batch is a powerful framework within the Spring ecosystem designed specifically for batch processing. Its architecture is built around several key components:

1. **Job**: The highest-level structure in Spring Batch. It represents a single unit of work to be executed, consisting of steps to be performed in a defined sequence.

2. **Step**: The step is a self-contained unit within a job that performs a specific task. Each step typically consists of an ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter.

    - **ItemReader**: Responsible for reading data. It fetches data from a source such as a file, database, or any other data store.
    
    - **ItemProcessor**: Optional component that processes the read data. It can transform or filter the data before sending it to the ItemWriter.
    
    - **ItemWriter**: Handles the output of processed data. It writes the processed data to the desired destination, like a file or database.

3. **JobRepository**: Responsible for managing metadata related to job execution. It stores details about jobs, steps, and their execution status. By default, it uses a database to persist this information.

4. **JobLauncher**: Initiates the execution of a job. It interacts with the JobRepository to create and manage job execution instances.

5. **Listeners**: Spring Batch provides listeners to intercept the execution of jobs and steps. These listeners allow custom code to be executed before or after specific events in the batch process.

6. **Schedulers**: While Spring Batch itself doesn't provide scheduling capabilities, it can be easily integrated with scheduling tools like Quartz Scheduler or Spring's TaskScheduler for scheduling batch job executions.

7. **Transactions**: Spring Batch manages transactions during the batch processing. It ensures that each step execution is wrapped in a transaction, providing features like rollback on failure and ensuring data integrity.

The typical flow in a Spring Batch application involves defining jobs composed of steps, each step reading, processing, and writing data. These jobs can be launched programmatically or scheduled to run at specific times using external schedulers.

Spring Batch provides robust error handling, restartability, and scalability features, making it suitable for handling large volumes of data efficiently. Its modular architecture allows developers to plug in custom implementations for readers, processors, writers, or other components, making it highly adaptable to various batch processing needs.

This diagram represents the flow and components in a Spring Batch architecture:

JobLauncher: Initiates the execution of a job.
Scheduler: Optional; can be integrated to schedule job executions.
JobRepository: Manages metadata about job executions.
Job Configuration: Configuration specifying job structure and steps.
Step Configuration: Configuration for each step including ItemReader, ItemProcessor, and ItemWriter.
ItemReader: Reads data from a source.
ItemProcessor: Processes data.
ItemWriter: Writes processed data to a destination.
This architecture showcases the flow from the JobLauncher to the JobRepository, through the Job and its configurations, down to the individual steps with their respective readers, processors, and writers.

Each component plays a specific role in the overall batch processing flow, allowing for modularity, customizability, and scalability within a Spring Batch application.


# By default the exceution is sync calls 

## to make the calls Async we need to implmenet TaskExecutor 

```

 // TaskExecutor bean to configure task execution
    @Bean
    public TaskExecutor taskExecutor() {
        SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor asyncTaskThread = new SimpleAsyncTaskExecutor();
        asyncTaskThread.setConcurrencyLimit(10);
        return asyncTaskThread;
    }

```

and step accepting the executor 

```

@Bean
    public Step step1() {
        return stepBuilderFactory.get("csv-step").<Customer, Customer>chunk(10)
                .reader(reader())
                .processor(processor())
                .writer(writer())
                .taskExecutor(taskExecutor())
                .build();
    }

```
